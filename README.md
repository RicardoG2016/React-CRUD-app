This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple CRUD app I created to test REACT functionality.

To run: 
* Git clone the repo.
* Have Node, JQuery, React, React-Dom and UUID installed. 
* In your terminal type "npm start"
* The app will run on localhost: 3000 by default.
