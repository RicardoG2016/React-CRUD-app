This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple CRUD app I create to test REACT functionality.

To run: 
* git clone the repo.
* have React installed and in your terminal type "npm start"
* The app will run on localhost: 3000 by default.
